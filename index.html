        <p>I have worked as a System Engineer for over 10 years.  Although system automation has been my main area of expertise, I also have a passion for design.  The desire to merge the two, led me to earn my Masters in Digital Media and become a Full Stack Developer. </p>
        <p>Web Development has allowed me to focus my creative expression on thoughtful and sensible design.</p>
        <p>When not chained to my desk staring at pixels, I enjoy roller skating, bike riding, and walking nature trails.</p>
